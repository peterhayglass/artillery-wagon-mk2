Version: 0.0.3
Date: 22 September 2021
Changes:
 - Battle Wagons mod is no longer required.  I still recommend it, and if you have it you can still use Battle Lasers in the Artillery Wagon Mk2.
 - Allow Battle Laser insert (from Battle Wagons mod) to be inserted into Power Armor Mk3 grid (from Rampant Arsenal mod), if you have both these mods installed.
 -- Neither of those mods is required
